Exploit DEV
when builing exploit, GDB needs to be run with this to fix stack align issue
env -i gdb -q -x ~/.gdbinit ./vuln

REASON
env -i ->clearn all env
gdb -q -x ~/.gdbinit -> quiet, use peda, and execute some basic command when start

during exploit on cmdline, exploit needs to be run with the following
env -i LINES=57 COLUMNS=165 PWD=$(pwd) /root/Desktop/exploit/vuln

REASON
env -i LINES=57 COLUMNS=165 PWD=$(pwd) -> clean all env, but set the 3 env(these 3 were set by GDB when it starts)
/root/Desktop/exploit/vuln -> need full path to program
